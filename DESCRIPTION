Description: Helps visualizing what is summarized in Pearson's correlation coefficient. That is, it visualizes its main constituent, namely the distances of the single values to their respective mean. The visualization thereby shows what the etymology of the word correlation contains: In pairwise combination, bringing back (see package Vignette for more details). I hope that the 'correlatio' package may benefit some people in understanding and critically evaluating what Pearson's correlation coefficient summarizes in a single number, i.e., to what degree and why Pearson's correlation coefficient may (or may not) be warranted as a measure of association.
